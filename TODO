TODO:
    * (optionally?) AND all search terms instead of ORing them
    * remove suggestions
    * rename "exact" to "case sensitive" (for now, exact still passes -i to locate)
    * drag and drop of filenames
    * save folder and window size across sessions
    * fix popup menu not being shown on first click

DONE:
    * remove all methods other than locate
